## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/souravlayek/remotefetch.git
cd remotefetch
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

Here is the `docker-compose.yml` file that sets up and runs the RemoteFetch application:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  remote-downloader:
    image: souravlayek/remote-fetch:latest
    container_name: remote-downloader
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./op:/app/output
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Setup with Docker Compose

1. **Start the Application:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This command will start the application in detached mode, creating and running the container as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

2. **Access the Application:**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the RemoteFetch web interface.

### Stopping the Application

To stop and remove the containers, networks, and volumes defined in `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Updating the Application

To pull the latest changes and update the application:

1. **Pull the Latest Image:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose pull
   ```

2. **Restart the Application:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Configuration

- **Volumes:** Local directory `./op` is mounted to `/output` in the container. Adjust the volume configuration in `docker-compose.yml` if needed.
- **Ports:** Port `3000` on your host is mapped to port `3000` in the container. Modify the port mappings in `docker-compose.yml` if necessary.
